To build an Electron app that monitors the price of a certain item on warframe.market, here’s a high-level plan:

UI: Create a simple interface to enter/select the item name and display the current price.
Fetch Data: Use the warframe.market API to fetch the item’s price.
Polling: Set up a timer to check the price at regular intervals.
Notification: Optionally, notify the user if the price drops below a threshold.
Tray: add a tray to know when the app is running
OPTIONAL: Statistics
